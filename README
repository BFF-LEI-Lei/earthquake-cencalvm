 * @author Brad Aagaard
 * @date 2005/08/03
 * @version 0.2.1
 *
 * @section summary Summary
 *
 * This directory tree contains the software used to create and query
 * the seismic velocity model covering the greater San Francisco Bay
 * area (central California) developed by the United States Geological
 * Survey.
 *
 * @note Updates to the data in the velocity model (the etree database
 * file) are generally independent of updates to the querying
 * software. This means the version numbers are also independent of
 * one another. In other words, unless the velocity model undergoes
 * fundamental changes in the way the data is stored, you can safely
 * use updated versions of the etree database without recompiling the
 * query software, and vice versa.
 *
 * @section installation Installation
 *
 * For installation instructions, see \ref install "INSTALL".
 *
 * @section dirs Directories
 *
 * @li \b doc Directory where the documentation for the query API
 * resides. The documentation is available online at
 * http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/baagaard/research/software/cencalvm/. You
 * can generate the documentation if you have doxygen installed by
 * running 'make' in the doc directory. The routines associated with
 * the user interface are labeled as such in the html documentation.
 *
 * @li \b pkgs Packages comprising cencalvm
 *
 * @subsection average Package 'average'
 *
 * This package is used to populate the interior octants of the etree
 * with averages of the children. In general, it is for internal use
 * only.
 *
 * @subsection create Package 'create'
 *
 * This package is used to create the etree database from Earth Vision
 * files. In general, it is for internal use only.
 *
 * @subsection query Package 'query'
 *
 * This package is used to query the etree database holding the
 * velocity model. See \ref queryREADME "pkgs/query/README" for
 * additional information on the query routines.
 *
 * @subsection storage Package 'storage'
 *
 * This package defines the geometry of the velocity model and
 * performs transformation of geographic coordinates to the etree
 * ticks. This package is used by the other packages. You should never
 * need to call the routines in this library directly.
 *
 * @section version Version history
 *
 * For information regarding changes, enhancements, significant bug
 * fixes, etc. see \ref changes "CHANGES".
