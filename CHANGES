/**
 * @file CHANGES Summary of changes made to cencalvm query software.
 *
 * \section ver022 Version 0.2.2, 2005/08/10
 *
 * @li Fixed bug where inclusion of assert header file was missing in
 * several source files. This resulted in compiler errors in some
 * cases.
 *
 * \section ver021 Version 0.2.1, 2005/08/03
 *
 * @li Fixed bug in creation routine where Vs for water (-999) was
 * scaled. 'No data' values should not be scaled. The query routine
 * was adjusted to undo this scaling, so 'no data' values will now be
 * consistent.
 * @li Fixed bug in MAXRES query routine. Interior octants were
 * returned in search of etree. Now if an interior octant is returned,
 * the values are set to 'no data'. This only occurred when querying
 * the etree at locations above topography and the water surface.
 * @li Added 'no data' and water points to examples for illustration
 * of those cases.
 * @li Added ability to make creation/averaging routines run quietly
 * (no progress reports).
 * @li Fixed bug in cencalvmcquery where filenames were not
 * initialized to empty string. This created filenames from garbage
 * and log files tended to created by default which is not the desired
 * behavior.
 *
 * \section ver020 Version 0.2.0, 2005/07/29
 *
 * @li Added error handler to allow queries to continue even when
 * values cannnot be found for locations. Coordinates of locations
 * where data was not found can be written to a log file. Values for
 * locations not found are set to predefined value (see \link
 * pkgs/query/README pkgs/query/README \endlink for details).
 * @li Fixed bugs in C and C++ examples associated with setting values
 * to be returned in a query.
 * @li Fixed documentation for units of cache size. Units are MB.
 * @li Added average package for creating database with spatial averaging.
 * @li Finished implementing routines and unit testing of queries
 * at fixed resolution or resolution based on wavelength of shear wave.
 *
 * \section ver011 Version 0.1.1, 2005/07/18
 *
 * @li Fixed errors in documentation and updated Make.mm files in examples
 * directory to reflect name of database in release pre1.0.
 *
 * \section ver010 Version 0.1.0, 2005/07/09 
 *
 * original version
