## Description

This software package is used to create and query the seismic velocity
model(s) covering the greater San Francisco Bay area and the
surrounding region developed by the United States Geological
Survey. See [3-D Geologic and Seismic Velocity Models of the San
Francisco Bay Region](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/3dgeologic/)
for information about the models and how to download the data files.

Updates to the data in the velocity model (the etree database file)
are generally independent of updates to the querying software. This
means the version numbers are also independent of one another. Unless
the velocity model undergoes fundamental changes in the way the data
is stored, you can safely use updated versions of the etree database
without recompiling the query software, and vice versa.
